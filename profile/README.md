Akka
====

*Akka is a powerful platform that simplifies building and operating highly responsive, resilient, and scalable services.*

The platform consists of
* the [**Akka SDK**](https://doc.akka.io/sdk/index.html) for straightforward, rapid development with AI assist and automatic clustering. Services built with the Akka SDK are automatically clustered and can be deployed on any infrastructure.
* and [**Akka Automated Operations**](https://doc.akka.io/operations/akka-platform.html), a managed solution that handles everything for Akka SDK services from auto-elasticity to multi-region high availability running safely within your VPC.

The **Akka SDK** and **Akka Automated Operations** are built upon the foundational [**Akka libraries**](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-dependencies/current/), providing the building blocks for distributed systems.

Akka has been downloaded more than 1 billion times and has powered thousands of systems for over 15 years.  Akka enables millions of concurrent users, terabyte stream processing, low-latency read/write data access, 99.9999% availability, and multi-region high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR).

Akka is used to build agentic AI, AI inference, transactional, analytical, digital twin, IOT, and edge-to-cloud systems. It is simple to learn and operate. Akka creates production-ready systems without requiring prior knowledge of events, threading, or distributed systems.
